# NAUGHTS AND CROSSES AI EXPERIMENT

A port of my Naughts project from Python 3 to Rust.

Current benchmarks are at least 4x faster than PyPy and more than 10x faster than CPython.
I also have a node.js port (TypeScript) and this Rust version is ~3x faster.

### What is it?

Naughts is a simple naughts and crosses "engine" including a collection of
AI bots.

It is a sandbox for testing AI / machine learning algorithms on turn-based 2-player games.
